# COMPUTER GRAPHICS (PRACTICALS) CLASS: CE 2 (SRID)

### MINI PROJECT ON COMPUTER GRAPHICS
Easy Studios, the makers of many Virtual Reality (VR) movies such as Avengers has contracted you to simulate a 3D virtual scene of moving train for their upcoming movie. Using OpenGL. in Codeblock, create a computer graphics program to have the following simulation details:
1. Objects like train, signal, and a place called "railway station".
2. There should be a train in which it will start arriving at the railway station when the signal light "green" is turned on.
3. The train should stop at the railway station when the red light is turned on and should not move from the railway station till the user displays the green light in the traffic signal when the green light is turned on then the train will start to depart from the railway station.
4. In the project, there should be night mode and day mode.
5. By pressing the right button in the mouse, you should see a menu on the screen. Which containing some options and if you click the left button of the mouse, you quit the program.
6. In the night mode, a comet movement should also be designed by the controls provided.

### ANSWER


1. State the technology you will use for this project.


        For this project, I used the OpenGL graphics library along with the GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) toolkit.
        OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API that allows us to render 3D graphics on a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
        GLUT provides a simple framework for creating OpenGL applications and handling user input events such as keyboard and mouse input.

        I used C++ as the programming language to implement the project.
        C++ is a powerful language with excellent support for object-oriented programming and system-level programming,
        making it an excellent choice for developing complex applications like computer graphics simulations.


2. Provide reasons for this choice of technology as compared to other technologies on the market.


        1. OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics API, which means that the same code can run on multiple operating systems,
            including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This makes it an ideal choice for developing cross-platform applications.

        2.  OpenGL provides access to hardware acceleration, which can significantly improve the
            performance of graphics applications. This is especially important for real-time simulations like the one we are developing.

        3.  OpenGL has a large and active community of developers who provide support and resources for developing
            graphics applications. This means that we can easily find resources, tutorials, and sample code online to help us develop our project.

        4.  OpenGL is widely used in the computer graphics industry, including video game development,
            virtual reality, and scientific visualization. This means that learning OpenGL can be beneficial for future career prospects.

        5.  GLUT provides a simple and lightweight framework for developing OpenGL applications,
            making it easy to get started with graphics programming without worrying too much about low-level details.
            This allows us to focus on the simulation itself, rather than the implementation details.
